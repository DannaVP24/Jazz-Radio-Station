                <h2>Jazz history</h2>
                <p>Jazz is a surprising human expression, born out of the suffering of the African people in slavery. <span>What that race has given to the world makes it different; of so much cruelty and so much destruction, it returned beauty and creation.</span></p>
                <p>The songs, the percussions and the imitation of natural voices was part of the legacy that the Africans brought with them to America between the centuries <span>XVII y XIX</span> In that life of imposed hopelessness, their songs became stories of oppression, work and supplication, and together with the European rhythms of the colonizers they drew the pattern for the creation of new rhythms and musical forms.</p>
                <h3>EVOLUTION</h3>
                <div id="izquierda">
                    <ul>
                        <li>In 1929, the era of Jazz ended and the genre had to reinvent itself into a new genre called Swing with Lou Armstrong.</li>
                        <li>Over time the form called Blue emerged, with 3 chords of 12 bars or choruses, from which innumerable variations started.</li>
                        <li>Towards the end of the 1930s he began Bebop, a new, faster style of Jazz, which broke with the structure of the Big Band and helped to return the figure of the musician to the role of virtuoso and innovator.</li>
                        <li>Subsequently, Bebop led to Hard Bop, which was the beginning of the way back to the origin which would culminate in Cool Jazz, with its two great influences, Gospel and Blues, as well as the Caribbean part.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div><div id="derecha">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cool Jazz started from the imitation of the great masters that emerged in the last years of the 19th century, with performances of calm colors, without falling into virtuosity.</li>
                        <li>Once the door to change was opened, evolution was continuous. Free Jazz emerged, the maximum expression of Hard Bop, a wave of European Jazz while the scenes strengthened, especially the Parisian one, and the Fusion genre that gave more weight to the Funk quality.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p><span>17 June, 2021</span></p>
                <p>The story about International Jazz Day has more background than we think. In 2011, UNESCO proclaimed such a day to sensitize the public about the qualities of this musical genre: in addition to being a gift to the ears, it is believed that jazz contributes to education about peace, unity, and cooperation between societies.</p>
